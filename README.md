# Project 1 - *Simple Todo*

**Simple Todo** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Andrew Le**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User's **list of items persisted** upon modification and and retrieved properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Constraints would not work properly without changing in the xml from Relative Layout back to Constraint Layout. As a result, some of the attributes may not match the ones in the tutorial videos.

The app on the emulator crashes every time I try to long click to remove an item on the list. I don't know if this is a problem with the emulator I'm having, the code, or my laptop, yet everything else seems to run fine. I excluded removing an item from my gif because of that.
